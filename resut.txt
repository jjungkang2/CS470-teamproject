in the last class we learned about a general Constable so generally Dai as a review of AI and you can actually formulate all different kinds of applications in dispute
in the last class we learned about a general concept of AI so generally we can view the AI as a sort of mapping function that maps your input data into the output so this is very general view of AI and we can actually formulate all different kinds of applications in this view

I'd like to give you a brief so this picture so we learn how we can find this image classification to
design of some sort of a convolution you're so
I'd like to give you a brief recap of fully convolution network so this FCN is the end to end CNN architecture for semantic segmentation so we learn how we can turn this CNN for image classification to segmentation network

it's basically the Minimax optimization so
it's basically the Minimax optimization so you should look at the inner maximize I mean inner optimization right so this is the loss function and in the inner term it's a basically the adversarial attack

is Yar are or the XO by means the classification Adder on the beta using the perturbations be so in this scenario we have a single conservation and when your flight is single perturbation so they ask where are the classification of matter
this ERR over the X of V means the classification error on the data using the perturbation V so in this scenario we have an only single perturbation and when we apply this single perturbation to the datas of X than ERR is the classification error
